  Hello, I am <strong>Sahil Bhuvad</strong>, a recent graduate with a
  <u>B.Sc. in Data Science</u> üéì <strong>(2025)</strong>. I currently reside in
  <mark>Mumbai, Virar, MH</mark> i gained practical experience through various data-driven projects. but here i am presenting my most advance 3 project only which is also my final year project.

  <p>For my final year project, I successfully developed and implemented an advanced Artificial Intelligence system designed to automatically detect the presence of bone fractures using medical X-ray images. By utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a sophisticated deep learning technique ideal for image analysis, I trained the system on a dataset of X-rays to accurately differentiate between fractured and non-fractured bones. The result is a valuable diagnostic aid, which I made accessible through a user-friendly web interface created with Gradio, demonstrating its potential for practical clinical use.
</p>



  <p>you can test my project by uploading your bone fracture image make sure image is clear and has no external object in it <a href="mailto:YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS">( view project >>>>>)</a></p>

  <p>Imagine a data scientist or analyst who constantly deals with new datasets. Each time, they have to write similar code for initial exploration: loading the data, checking its structure, getting summary statistics, visualizing distributions, and identifying missing values. This project aims to create a Colab notebook that automates these repetitive EDA tasks. Think of it as a one-stop-shop where you can upload any dataset, run a few cells, and instantly get a comprehensive overview of its characteristics, patterns, and potential issues. This notebook will save time and effort, allowing users to focus on deeper analysis and insights rather than the initial data wrangling.

						<p>Meet Priya, the busy inventory manager at "Fresh Foods Supermarket." Every morning, Priya would wade through spreadsheets, trying to figure out how much milk was in the warehouse, how many loaves of bread were on the shelves, and whether they needed to order more apples. It was a constant juggling act, leading to either empty shelves frustrating customers or overstocked items going to waste. Priya dreamt of a simpler way, a magic mirror that could show her exactly what was happening with her inventory in real-time. That's when the idea of an automated dashboard sparked. Priya envisioned a system where every time a delivery arrived, every time a box was moved to the store, and every time a customer bought something, the information would automatically flow into a smart system. This system would then paint a clear picture on a screen, showing her exactly what she needed to know ‚Äì what to order, what was selling well, and if any shelves were about to go bare. Priya knew this automated dashboard wouldn't just save her time; it would ensure Fresh Foods always had the right products for their customers, making everyone happy.
